# Bunker project 
Tech-demo game making for portfolio on Unreal Engine 5.6

## *WORK IN PROGRESS*


## What it will be
The player must escape from the bunker by interacting with the environment. The entire visual series is built on primitives and self-made simple 3d-models

## Controls
- WASD - movement
- Mouse - camera 
- E - interact
- Tab - show/hide inventory
- LMB - collect (in inspection)
- Scroll Up/Down - "scale" (in inspection)
- Esc - pause menu or exit interaction


## What is already done
- Flashlight *(don't really need it rn, but it was easy, so I've done it)*
- Interactable objects made via single interaction interface which supports different types of interaction *(type of interaction displaed as letter in widget)*
- Collectable objects and simple inventory (items could be added and removed from it)
- Some object-object interaction logic, demonstrated by lights and switcher 
- Testing area with examples
- Simple pause menu


## What is in plans
- Computers with complex UI
- Custom materials for different surfaces
- Horror segment
- AI
- Probably simple puzzles
- Areas with different mechanics and moods
- Level streaming
- Save/load game 
- ?....
